# Ray on Golem Alpha Mainnet Preview Program

Welcome to the Ray on Golem Alpha Mainnet Preview Program!

If you've ever tried scaling your Python code to process large data sets or solve complex computational tasks, you'll know that it may be challenging in various ways.
With Ray on Golem, we're aiming to make this as straightforward as possible, and we invite you to help us make it happen.

Therefore, we'd like to thank you for your interest in the Preview Program.
Its purpose is to field test the new Ray on Golem along with its documentation: https://docs.golem.network/docs/creators/ray.

Our current line of releases is a sneak peek, with a happy path working on both our test and main networks.
We publish these releases and run subsequent editions of our preview program to verify the potential
of our product against real users' needs.

At the time, we're limiting our tests to Ray on Golem on **Linux**, since we want to focus on the core experience and not on idiosyncrasies of particular platforms on which Golem or Ray in general can run.
The task described below will help you broaden your knowledge while actively contributing to the improvement of the Golem Network.

We have rewards for 10 people (USD 90 + 10 to cover the expense of acquiring mainnet funds) that you will be able to claim via Upwork after completing the task.
Note that only those who filled out the qualification survey and were contacted on Discord with a link to Upwork are eligible to participate.
We estimate the task should take 1-3 hours to complete.

If you have any questions, we encourage you to contact the Ray on Golem team directly on [Discord: `#Ray on Golem` channel](https://discord.gg/golem) in the Golem projects section.

We also invite you to visit https://www.golem.network/, where you can find more basic information about our open-source project.

## Task: execute a basic Ray script on the Golem mainnet (topping up your wallet along the way)

**Goal**: Evaluate if it is easy to top up Ray on Golem wallet and use the funds

**Task**: Set up Ray on Golem on the mainnet (topping the wallet up), and share the feedback about budget control parts of Ray on Golem.

**Steps**:
- Go through [Ray on Golem documentation](https://docs.golem.network/docs/creators/ray)
- Run an example code on the testnet
- Switch to mainnet
- Follow the instructions for getting the mainnet funds (buy around USD 10 worth of GLM and MATIC, which might require a simple KYC)
- Run the chosen example on the mainnet (save the console output and Ray on Golem debug log file to share with us)
- Go through [budget control](https://docs.golem.network/docs/creators/ray/cluster-yaml#budget-control) and see if it sounds usable and understandable
- Go through [accessing the Internet](https://docs.golem.network/docs/creators/ray/cluster-yaml#outbound) article and see if it sounds and understandable
- Send us your wallet address (so we can see real GLMs), the console output of the code execution on the mainnet, and Ray on Golem debug log file.
- Fill out the [submission form](https://qkjx8blh5hm.typeform.com/to/UlpvzPrD) (wallet, the logs, and meaningful and thought-out feedback)

**Troubleshooting**

Should anything go wrong, check out the [troubleshooting section](https://docs.golem.network/docs/creators/ray/troubleshooting) for a possible solution.
If this doesn't help please reach out to us on [Discord: `#Ray on Golem` channel](https://discord.gg/golem). 
Ideally, please also upload the [webserver debug logs](https://docs.golem.network/docs/creators/ray/troubleshooting#ray-on-golem-s-log-files).

### The documentation

While going over the documentation consider its clarity, purpose, structure & completeness - we will be asking about this at the end.
The direction we should take with the docs is an important aspect of the Preview Program for us.

After you succeed in running the code on the mainnet please read two new articles. 
We're particularly interested in any feedback you may have on the usability of the mechanisms that we offer and present in our documentation for the work you usually do, or for any interesting projects that you have in mind.

### Acceptance criteria 

In the end, the wallet inside Ray on Golem should have mainnet funds.

We also expect logs from successful execution on the mainnet.

The last requirement is thought-out feedback about our documentation and product.

Please don't hesitate to talk to us on [Discord: `#Ray on Golem` channel`](https://discord.gg/golem) - we would love to see what you struggle with.
At the same time, we don't want to waste your time on powering through the rough edges of our young product.

### Fill out the submission form

The final step is to submit your wallet address, the logs, and your feedback via the [submission form](todo).

Remember that your insights have the power to refine and propel Ray on Golem forward.
Apart from the successful completion of the above task, the most attractive feedback for us would be your ideas for real-life Ray on Golem applications.
Ideally, the ones that you would like to implement yourself.
We need reference usages and are willing to actively support their potential creators.
