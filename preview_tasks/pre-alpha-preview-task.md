# Ray on Golem pre-alpha Preview Program

Welcome to the Ray on Golem pre-alpha Preview Program description!

Thank you for your interest in the Preview Program. 
Its purpose is to test the new Ray on Golem solution with its documentation at https://docs.golem.network/docs/creators/ray.

The pre-alpha release is a sneak-peak, with happy path working on our test network. We publish the release and run the preview program 
to get it out of the building - to start verifying the potential to decide on further investment in Ray on Golem. 

This article contains a set of tasks that you can complete to broaden your knowledge and help improve the Golem Network.

We have rewards for 10 people (600 GLM each) - we will communicate via Discord.
We want to test Ray on Golem on **Linux**.

If you have any questions, we encourage you to contact the Ray on Golem team directly - join our community on [Discord](https://chat.golem.network) and find the `#Ray on Golem` channel in the Golem projects section.

We also encourage you to visit https://www.golem.network/, where you can find more basic information about our open-source project.
