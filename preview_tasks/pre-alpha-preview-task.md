# Ray on Golem pre-alpha Preview Program

Welcome to the Ray on Golem pre-alpha Preview Program description!

Thank you for your interest in the Preview Program. 
Its purpose is to test the new Ray on Golem solution with its documentation: https://docs.golem.network/docs/creators/ray.

The pre-alpha release is a sneak-peak, with a happy path working on our test network. We published the release and decided 
to run the preview program to get it out of the building - to start verifying the potential 
and decide if further investment in Ray on Golem is justified.

**We want to test Ray on Golem on Linux**.
The set of tasks described below will help you broaden your knowledge while contributing to the improvement of the Golem Network. 

We have rewards for 10 people (100 USD each) - that you will be able to claim via Upwork after completing the task. 
Note that only those who filled the qualification survey and were contacted on Discord with a link to Upwork are eligible to participate.

If you have any questions, we encourage you to contact the `Ray on Golem` team directly on Discord: `#Ray on Golem` channel in the Golem projects section.

We also encourage you to visit https://www.golem.network/, where you can find more basic information about our open-source project.
